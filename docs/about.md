Hope you're enjoying this application! Documentation on all keys can be found in the Reference tab above. To report
an issue, please visit the the app's [Github page](https://github.com/idreyn/sigmabox).

Sigmabox is developed single-handedly by me, Ian Reynolds. I am a college student and this is a thing I do in my spare time. 
The app is free and doesn't have any ads -- in fact, the source is on Github and available under an MIT license, so you can do more or less anything
you want with it. If you find this app useful, please consider making a small donation from the Github page. This will enable me to do things like respond
to bug reports promptly, add new features, and hack away at a desktop version.

For the curious, Sigmabox is built in HTML5. It makes use of a little DSL I wrote called [Elemental](https://github.com/idreyn/elemental) along with [Hammer JS](http://hammerjs.github.io/) and [iScroll](https://iscroll.com).

That's numberwang!
